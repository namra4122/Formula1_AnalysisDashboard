I am currently putting together a dashboard for formula 1 analysis. Permit me to explain how the application is organised.
Right now, I have two dropdown menus. The first one contains a list of years in which the formula one season was held.
The data for the menu is obtained from an API. Currently, the value that is selected from the first dropdown menu is used as a
parameter for the other api that we will use to add data to the second dropdown menu. This entire section is functioning wonderfully,
but now I would like to add photographs of the circuit. Could you assist me in locating the images of the circuit that the user 
has chosen to display? I need some form of application programming interface (API) or map API so that I may show that circuit 
within my application by using latitudes and longitudes.
